=== __v6.1.0__ ===

**General**

* ToC Update.

**API**

* Calling the Group:Delete() method no longer hides the options frame.

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed an issue with the mini-map icon option not appearing.
* Fixed the "General" options group so that "Masque - General" is displayed rather than "Masque - Masque".
* Fixed disabled state inheritance.

**Miscellaneous**

* Masque will now use the esES locale for esMX, since they're nearly identical.

=== __v6.0.0__ ===

**General**

* Updated for WoD.
* The legacy support add-on "ButtonFacade" and its associated library have been removed.  If an add-on or skin you use throws an error... Seriously, it's been //years//.  Update or adapt.
* The options panel is now always load-on-demand.

**API**

* A new API method, :UpdateSpellAlert(Button) is available. This will allow add-ons that use internal spell alert methods to have them updated by Masque.
* The callback for an add-on registered with Masque will now have a 6th parameter (not counting **self**) set to **true** if the group has been disabled or to **nil** otherwise.
* The Static parameter for Group methods has been removed.
* The following legacy group methods have been removed:
  ** GetLayerColor
  ** AddSubGroup
  ** RemoveSubGroup
  ** SetLayerColor
  ** Skin
  ** ResetColors

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed an issue that was preventing a group's options from being removed from the options panel.
  ** To prevent errors, the options panel will close (if open) when the Group:Delete() method is called.
* The options panel should now correctly show and set the focus to the "Add-Ons" panel when the "Load Options" button is pressed.
