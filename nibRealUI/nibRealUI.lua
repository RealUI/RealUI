-- nibRealUI Migration Stub
-- This addon exists solely to load the old nibRealUIDB and nibRealUICharacter
-- SavedVariables so they can be migrated to the new RealUI addon.
--
-- When WoW loads this addon, it will load the SavedVariables from:
-- WTF/Account/[AccountName]/SavedVariables/nibRealUI.lua
--
-- The variables are automatically made available globally by WoW's SavedVariables
-- system, so the RealUI addon can access them for migration.

-- This file intentionally left minimal - no code needed
-- The TOC file's SavedVariables declaration does all the work
